## What is this?

My company has a client who's been using Knack (Knack.com) for over a year now and I've helped write some nice frameworks and scripts for Knack and Wordpress (and other) integrations. I'm going to try releasing them slowly, most of them are pretty customized so releasing them is a bit pointless for most people, so I'll be going slowly with this. If you're using Knack and WP and are looking for stuff in a more expedited manner, feel free to PM me.
